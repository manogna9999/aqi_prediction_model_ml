# aqi_prediction_model_ml
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using real-time data from various pollutants. By leveraging machine learning models, the tool provides timely AQI forecasts to enhance public awareness and support proactive measures against air pollution.

# Overview

. Air pollution is a global issue that impacts health and the environment. This project predicts AQI values using data from key pollutants such as:
. PM2.5 and PM10 (fine particulate matter)
. NOx (Nitrogen oxides)
. NH3 (Ammonia)
. CO (Carbon monoxide)
. SO2 (Sulfur dioxide)
. O3 (Ozone)
. VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds like Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene)
The tool uses machine learning to analyze pollutant data and predict AQI with high accuracy.

# Features

- Real-time AQI prediction using pollutant data.
- User-friendly interface for easy access to forecasts.
- Integration-ready with environmental monitoring systems.
- Public health recommendations based on AQI levels.

# Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy and Pandas for data preprocessing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
- Model: Random Forest Regression

# How It Works

Data Collection: Pollutant data is collected from reliable sources.
Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, and features are engineered to capture trends and interactions.
Model Training: Machine learning models analyze pollutant data to predict AQI.
Prediction: The trained model forecasts AQI in real-time.

# Usage

- Provide pollutant data through the input interface.
- View the predicted AQI value and public health recommendations.
- Use the tool to plan actions to reduce exposure to air pollution.

# Future Enhancements

- Adding advanced deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset to include global air quality data.
- Creating APIs for real-time integration with mobile applications.
